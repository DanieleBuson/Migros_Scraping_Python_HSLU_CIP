Purpose: extract two different dataset, one with the quantity as a float 
    representing the grams, one with the quantity as a float representing liters. 

Reason: it would be interesting for the analysis to have this columns ready for being used.
    In addition it would be possible to extract the price per gram (or liter).

1. Bread and pastries Cleaning
    
    Grams:
        How:    1. we check if the quantity string ends with kg or g. 

                2. if it ends with "kg" => we check potential errors. We incorporate the
                    entire code into a try except statement not to crash the program.
                    Since we are dealing with "kg" but we want "g", we multiply 1000 to 
                    the number of kg.

                    2.1 we check all the records that have a "x" in the string. This is a 
                        common case, we extract the string before and after and we perform
                        a casting into float. Then we multiply the numbers obtained.
                    2.2 we check that the string contains the letters "er". In that case we 
                        simply cut the string into two pieces, the er part is add to the product string
                        using concatenation, the second part is extracted and transformed into a float
                    2.3 we applied the same procedure for the word "Stück" that usually appears in the 
                        raw data. However, in this case we only extract the second element generated from
                        teh split and extract the number as a float.
                    2.4 we check the presence of a %. This usually happens due to the fact that, cutting 
                        the strings on the numbers, some products name has inside a percentage.
                        In this case the percentage is stored with the quantity. That is why 
                        it is necessary to extract the right quantity. Therefore, we cut the string on 
                        the percentage, and cut again on the first number. Then we can fix with 
                        concatenation of string the product, and using casting we can have float
                        values for the quantity column.
                    2.5 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.

                3. if it ends "g" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index. 

                5. We create a csv table using the Pandas method to_csv().

    Liters:
        How:    1. we check if the quantity string ends with ml or l.

                2. if it ends with "ml" => we check potential errors. We incorporate the
                    entire code into a try except statement not to crash the program.
                    Since we are dealing with "ml" but we want "l", we divide 1000 to 
                    the number of ml.

                    2.1 we check all the records that have a "x" in the string. This is a 
                        common case, we extract the string before and after and we perform
                        a casting into float. Then we multiply the numbers obtained.
                    2.2 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.
                
                3. if it ends with "l" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index.

                    Since we are dealing with "kg" but we want "g", we multiply 1000 to 
                    the number of kg.

                    2.1 we check all the records that have a "x" in the string. This is a 
                        common case, we extract the string before and after and we perform
                        a casting into float. Then we multiply the numbers obtained.
                    2.2 we check that the string contains the string "fat". It is a common case
                        when dealing with milk and cheese. We split the string on the word "fat" and we 
                        update both columns (product and quantity in float), cutting on the first digit.
                    2.3 we check that the string contains the string "slices" or "slices2 x". Both were selected
                        since there are more than one record that has this issue. Therefore, we cut the string and 
                        we extract the quantity as a float
                    2.4 we check the presence of a %. This usually happens due to the fact that, cutting 
                        the strings on the numbers, some products name has inside a percentage.
                        In this case the percentage is stored with the quantity. That is why 
                        it is necessary to extract the right quantity. Therefore, we cut the string on 
                        the percentage, and cut again on the first number. Then we can fix with 
                        concatenation of string the product, and using casting we can have float
                        values for the quantity column.
                    2.5 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.

                3. if it ends "g" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index.

                    Since we are dealing with "ml" but we want "l", we divide 1000 to 
                    the number of ml.

                    2.2 we check the presence of a %. This usually happens due to the fact that, cutting 
                        the strings on the numbers, some products name has inside a percentage.
                        In this case the percentage is stored with the quantity. That is why 
                        it is necessary to extract the right quantity. Therefore, we cut the string on 
                        the percentage, and cut again on the first number. Then we can fix with 
                        concatenation of string the product, and using casting we can have float
                        values for the quantity column.
                    2.3 We extract the word "2Sparkling" and we split the string on the first digit. 
                        Then we update the product column through string concatenation and the quantity
                        column with a float value. 
                    2.4 We check for the word "smoothie" and cut the string on that separator. Then, we 
                        extract just the quantity as a float. 
                    2.5 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.
                
                3. if it ends with "cl", "dl" or "l" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement. In each case we carefully divide to have the right amount of liters.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index.

                    2.2 we check that the string contains the string "intensity". It is a common case
                        when dealing with coffe. We split the string on the value intensity and we 
                        update both columns (product and quantity in float).
                    2.3 we check that the string contains the string "strenght". As before it is 
                        common case when dealing with coffe. 
                    2.4 we check the presence of a %. This usually happens due to the fact that, cutting

                    2.6 we can check the presence of three different words "BTL", "KG" and "Pads". In this case
                        we just split the string on these separators and extract just the quantity as a float.
                    2.7 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.

                        using concatenation, the second part is extracted and transformed into a float
                    2.3 we applied the same procedure for the words "Stück", "pieces" or "pièces" that usually appears

                3. if it ends "g" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index. 

                5. We create a csv table using the Pandas method to_csv().

    Liters:
        How:    1. In this case we do not have records in liters.

7. Pasta and Canned Food

    Grams:
        How:    1. we check if the quantity string ends with kg or g. 

                2. if it ends with "kg" => we check potential errors. We incorporate the
                    entire code into a try except statement not to crash the program.
                    Since we are dealing with "kg" but we want "g", we multiply 1000 to 
                    the number of kg.

                    2.1 we check all the records that have a "x" in the string. This is a 
                        common case, we extract the string before and after and we perform
                        a casting into float. Then we multiply the numbers obtained.
                    2.2 we check that the string contains the letters "er". In that case we 
                        simply cut the string into two pieces, the er part is add to the product string
                        using concatenation, the second part is extracted and transformed into a float
                    2.3 we applied the same procedure for the words "pieces", "liters" or "G" that usually appears
                        in the raw data. However, in this case we only extract the second element generated from
                        teh split and extract the number as a float.
                    2.4 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.

                3. if it ends "g" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                5. We create a csv table using the Pandas method to_csv().

    Liters:
        How:    1. we check if the quantity string ends with ml or l.

                2. if it ends with "ml" => we check potential errors. We incorporate the
                    entire code into a try except statement not to crash the program.
                    Since we are dealing with "ml" but we want "l", we divide 1000 to 
                    the number of ml.

                    2.1 we check all the records that have a "x" in the string. This is a 
                        common case, we extract the string before and after and we perform
                        a casting into float. Then we multiply the numbers obtained.
                    2.2 we check the presence of a %. This usually happens due to the fact that, cutting 
                        the strings on the numbers, some products name has inside a percentage.
                        In this case the percentage is stored with the quantity. That is why 
                        it is necessary to extract the right quantity. Therefore, we cut the string on 
                        the percentage, and cut again on the first number. Then we can fix with 
                        concatenation of string the product, and using casting we can have float
                        values for the quantity column.
                    2.3 if it is not any of these cases we simply try to cut on the initial separator.
                
                3. if it ends with "cl" or "l" => we check for the same possible errors, always using a try except
                    statement.

                4. Once we have obtained the data, we use dropna() function to remove every record
                    containing a nan. Then, we reset the index.
